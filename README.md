# RuneCLI
RuneCLI is a lightweight, text-based role-playing game built entirely in C++. Designed to run in the terminal, the game offers a nostalgic experience inspired by classic turn-based RPGs. Players create a character, battle enemies, manage inventory, and level up â€” all through simple command-line interactions.
